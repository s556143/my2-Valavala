###### Gollaprollu
My grandparents' house was one of my **favorite** childhood haunts, and it makes for the ideal gateway. I have many happy childhood memories of my family and enjoying ourselves there. Gollaprollu is where my grandparents' home is. The house is quite **peacefull** and nice, ans it is encircled by a lovely garden with full of flowers.
